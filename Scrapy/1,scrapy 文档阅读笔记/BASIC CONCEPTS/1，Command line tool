1，【Default structure of Scrapy projects】
myproject/
    scrapy.cfg
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        items.py
        middlewares.py
        pipelines.py
        settings.py
        spiders/
            __init__.py
            spider1.py
            spider2.py
            ...


2,The directory where the scrapy.cfg file resides is known as
the project root directory. That file contains the name of the python module
that defines the project settings. Here is an example:
>>>[settings]
>>>default = myproject.settings
A project root directory, the one that contains the scrapy.cfg, may be shared by multiple Scrapy projects, each with its own settings module.
In that case, you must define one or more aliases for those settings modules under [settings] in your scrapy.cfg file:
[settings]
default = myproject1.settings
project1 = myproject1.settings
project2 = myproject2.settings


3,命令行使用帮助，命令使用范围
>>>scrapy <command> -h
>>>scrapy -h
